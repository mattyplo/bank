#  bank
bank is a web application for a user to create an asset portfolio of stocks, mutual funds, and bank accounts in order to keep track of and analyze assets.  


## Motivation
The project was designed to integrate new technologies into my skill set.  The idea was to learn a framework, in this case cakePHP, in order to rapidly develop a web application and utilize MVC architecture.  Another goal of this project was to consume an outside API, in this case Alpha Vantage, to integrate relevant up to date information on specific stocks and mutual funds.

## Frameworks
cakePHP
